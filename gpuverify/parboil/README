Kernels are arranged by test/kernel, with the test/_data folder containing a
file of intercepted parameters, named by the dataset they were gotten from.



tpacf fails in the original parboil tests on a Debian Wheezy VM with AMD APP,
and so sizes and parameters may be wrong.

It compiles/runs/finishes all fine, but returns the wrong answer according to
the parboil test hook. This could be a bug in their code, some issue with
AMDAPP, or not liking the CPU profile - all the parboil tests ask for GPU, I
replaced that with CPU to get them to run, but they've otherwise all been OK.
